# Git Interview Notes

** Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to track changes in source code and other files during software development. 
** you can initialize a repository with git init or clone an existing one with git clone <url>. For more advanced usage, commands like git add, git commit, git push, and git pull are fundamental.

## 1. Branching and Merging
- **Branching**: Create isolated environments for features/bug fixes (`git branch <name>`, `git checkout <name>`).
- **Merging**: Combine changes from different branches (`git merge <branch>`).
- **Merge strategies**: 
    - **Fast-forward**: A simple pointer move when there are no divergent commits.
    - **Recursive**: The default strategy for merges, creates a new merge commit.
    - **Squash**: Combines all commits from a feature branch into a single commit on the target branch.
    - **Rebase**: Moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the target branch, creating a linear history.
- **Merge conflicts**: Occur when changes in different branches overlap. You must manually edit the conflicted files to resolve the differences.

## 2. Staging and Commit History
- **Staging area (Index)**: A file that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Use `git add <file>` to stage changes.
- **Amending commits**: Modify the most recent commit with `git commit --amend`. Useful for fixing typos or adding forgotten files.
- **Viewing history**: 
    - `git log`: Shows the commit history.
    - `git reflog`: Shows a log of where your HEAD and branch references have been. It's useful for recovering lost commits.
- **Reverting & Resetting**:
    - `git revert <commit>`: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a specified commit, preserving the project history.
    - `git reset <commit>`: Moves the current branch tip backward to a specified commit, potentially altering history. It has three modes: `--soft`, `--mixed` (default), and `--hard`.

## 3. Remote Repositories
- **Remotes**: A pointer to another copy of the repository. Use `git remote add <name> <url>` to add a new remote.
- **Fetch**: Downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo (`git fetch <remote>`).
- **Pull**: Fetches from a remote and immediately tries to merge it into your current branch (`git pull <remote> <branch>`). It's a shortcut for `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.
- **Push**: Uploads your local branch commits to the remote repository (`git push <remote> <branch>`).
- **Tracking branches**: A local branch that has a direct relationship to a remote branch.

## 4. Collaboration Workflows
- **Forking**: A personal copy of someone else's repository that lives on your account.
- **Pull requests (PRs)**: A way to propose your changes to the original repository.
- **Rebasing vs. Merging**: 
    - **Rebasing** creates a cleaner, linear history.
    - **Merging** preserves the exact history of what happened.
- **Cherry-picking**: The act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another (`git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`).

## 5. Advanced Features
- **Stashing**: Temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else (`git stash`, `git stash pop`).
- **Tagging**: Marks a specific point in history as important, typically used for releases (`git tag <tag-name>`).
- **Submodules**: Allows you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository (`git submodule add <repository-url> <path>`).

## 6. Troubleshooting
- **Undoing changes**: Use `git checkout -- <file>` to discard changes in the working directory, `git reset` to unstage, or `git revert` to undo a commit.
- **Detached HEAD**: This state occurs when you check out a commit that is not the tip of a branch. To save your work, create a new branch with `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`.
- **Recovering lost commits**: Use `git reflow` to find the hash of the lost commit and then restore it.

## 7. Configuration and Hooks
- **`.gitignore`**: A text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.
- **`.gitattributes`**: Defines attributes per path. For example, you can manage line endings.
- **Hooks**: Scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive. They are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory.
## Git commands

1. Setup & Initialization
git config --global user.name "[name]"
Explanation: Sets the name that will be attached to your commits and tags. This is a one-time setup on a new machine.
git config --global user.email "[email address]"
Explanation: Sets the email address that will be attached to your commits.
git init
Explanation: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This creates a hidden .git folder to track changes.
git clone [url]
Explanation: Creates a local copy of a remote repository, including all its history and branches.
2. The Daily Workflow
git status
Explanation: Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
git add [file] or git add .
Explanation: Adds file changes from your working directory to the staging area. This prepares them to be included in the next commit. git add . stages all modified and new files in the current directory.
git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
Explanation: Takes the staged snapshot and saves it permanently to the project history with a descriptive message.
git pull
Explanation: Fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current local branch. It's a combination of git fetch and git merge.
git push
Explanation: Uploads your committed changes from your local branch to the corresponding remote branch.
3. Branching & Merging
git branch
Explanation: Lists all of the branches in your repository. The current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk.
git branch [branch-name]
Explanation: Creates a new branch, but does not switch to it.
git checkout [branch-name]
Explanation: Switches your current working directory to the specified branch.
git checkout -b [branch-name]
Explanation: A shortcut command that creates a new branch and immediately switches to it.
git merge [branch-name]
Explanation: Combines the history of the specified branch into the current branch.
git rebase [branch-name]
Explanation: Takes the commits from your current branch and reapplies them on top of another branch. This creates a cleaner, more linear history than merging.
4. Inspecting History
git log
Explanation: Displays the commit history for the current branch.
git log --oneline --graph
Explanation: A useful variation that shows a condensed, one-line summary of each commit along with a graph of the branch structure.
git diff
Explanation: Shows the differences between your working directory and the staging area.
git diff --staged
Explanation: Shows the differences between the staging area and your last commit.
5. Undoing Changes
git checkout -- [file]
Explanation: Discards the changes in a specific file in your working directory, reverting it to the version from the last commit. Use with caution, as this is destructive.
git reset [file]
Explanation: Unstages a file, but preserves its contents in the working directory.
git commit --amend
Explanation: Lets you modify the most recent commit. You can change the commit message or add more files to it.
git revert [commit-hash]
Explanation: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a specified commit. This is the safest way to undo changes that have already been pushed to a remote repository.
git stash
Explanation: Temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can switch branches or work on something else. git stash pop restores the stashed changes.
6. Working with Remotes
git remote -v
Explanation: Lists all the remote repositories you have configured, along with their URLs.
git fetch [remote]
Explanation: Downloads all the history from the remote repository but does not merge it. This allows you to review changes before integrating them.
git push [remote] --delete [branch-name]
Explanation: Deletes a branch on the specified remote repository.
