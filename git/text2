here we are here to learn how git is used in our daily life 
git is the version control system
git is very useful for developers
git is used to track changes in source code during software development
git is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files
its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel
git is free and open source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2
git is a distributed version control system (DVCS)
in a DVCS, every user has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine
this allows users to work offline and commit changes locally before pushing them to a central repository
git uses a data structure called a "commit" to represent changes to the codebase
each commit contains a snapshot of the entire codebase at a specific point in time, along with metadata such as the author, timestamp, and commit message
git also uses branches to allow multiple lines of development to occur simultaneously
branches are lightweight pointers to commits that enable users to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase
once the work on a branch is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch
git also provides powerful tools for collaboration, such as pull requests and code reviews
these features allow developers to propose changes, discuss them, and ensure code quality before integrating them into the main codebase
overall, git is a powerful and flexible tool that has become the standard for version control in software development2
git is widely used in both open source and commercial software projects, and has a large and active community of users and contributors
git is supported by many popular platforms, such as GitHub.
